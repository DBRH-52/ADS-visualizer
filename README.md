# Algorithms and Data Structures visualizer

A web application for visualizing algorithms and data structures with interactive animations and step-by-step explanations.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch algorithms execute in real-time with step-by-step animations
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Support for sorting, searching, graph, and tree algorithms
- **Data Structure Demonstrations**: Visualize arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed to understand the process better
- **Step-by-Step Mode**: Pause and step through algorithms manually
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ESLint 9](https://eslint.org/)


## Usage

1. Select an algorithm or data structure from the navigation
2. Configure the input parameters (array size, values, etc.)
3. Click "Start Visualization" to begin the animation
4. Use the controls to pause, step through, or adjust speed
5. Observe the step-by-step execution with visual feedback


## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- [ ] Implement graph algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS)
- [ ] Add binary tree and heap visualizations
- [ ] Support for custom input data
- [ ] Export animations as GIF/MP4
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n)
